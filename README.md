# c_laboratory_work

Principles:

0. Don't tread on me.
1. Don't repeat yourself.
2. Keep it simple, stupid.
3. You aren't gonna need it.

Name system:
laboratoryNumber.taskNumber(postfix).c

postfix `clear` for exactly what was needed on the task.

postfix `alternative` for little bit different code but different implementation.
